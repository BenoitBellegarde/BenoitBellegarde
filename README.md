👨‍💻 Hey there! I'm Benoit Bellegarde, a full stack web developer with 7 years of experience 🚀

🎓 I master HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery with a particular soft spot for Typescript. I also love working with React and NextJS for building dynamic, performant web apps. 🌟

📱 I've even dabbled in mobile development, using Cordova to create hybrid apps. And for backend work, I'm proficient in PHP and PostgreSQL. 🤓

🚀 Currently, I'm focused on my latest project: **UltimateTab**. It's built using NextJS and ChakraUI, and I'm excited to see where it takes me! 🚀

💻 If you're interested in seeing some of my work, be sure to check out my Github repositories. And if you have any questions or just want to say hi, don't hesitate to reach out! 👋
